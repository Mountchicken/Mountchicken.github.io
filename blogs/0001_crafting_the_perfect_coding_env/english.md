A well-optimized coding environment can make all the difference in a developer's productivity and overall experience. Imagine a space where every tool you need is at your fingertips, distractions are minimized, and your workflow is seamless. This is the kind of environment we aim to create with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and a carefully selected set of plugins.

In this guide, we will walk you through the essentials of setting up VSCode, one of the most popular and powerful code editors available today. We'll explore how to customize it with the right plugins to enhance your coding experience, making it not only efficient but also enjoyable.

- **You can pass this section if you are already using VSCode. Please allow me to spend some time convincing those are not**
- Without doubt, VSCode is the **most popular** code editor by combining ease of use and popular IDE features.
- As a loyal user of VSCode, let me put some fancy features in VSCode that help me a lot in my deep learning life.
  - **Extremely fast** launching speed, just in a second
  - **Freedom of customization.** If you don't like so much the basic design proposed by default, you can create your customized themes with high flexibility that lets you customize nearly all UI elements of the editor. If you don't have the time to create one by yourself, you can choose a theme from the thousands available on the market; many of them are very nice.
  - **Well support Git.** Git is a commonly used development tool and even if you are not familiar with git, you can still manage to use it with the user-friendly operations provided in VSCode.
  - **World's best market.** There are literally thousands of extensions in the VS Code marketplace with new ones coming seemingly every single day.
